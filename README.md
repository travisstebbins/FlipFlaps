# FlipFlaps
A C++ game of flipping and ordering a stack of virtual pancakes

FlipFlaps requires you to have FLTK (Fast Light Tookit) installed in order to run. 
The game was also created with some interface files for FLTK (located in the FLTK 
Interface folder).

The files can be compiled by running the command "g++ -std=c++14 *cpp *o -lfltk -lfltk_images" 
in the main folder.

A detailed report of the project can be found in ProjectReport.docx
